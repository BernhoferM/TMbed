# TMbed - Data Sets

Data sets used during the development of TMbed.

All sequences have been collected from [OPM](https://opm.phar.umich.edu/) [1] and [UniProtKB](https://www.uniprot.org/) [2] between Jan 9 and Jan 10, 2022.

The `datasets` directory contains the three annotated data sets:
- `beta.fasta`: Transmembrane beta barrel proteins
- `alpha.fasta`: Transmembrane alpha helical proteins
- `signalp.fasta`: Globular proteins from the [SignalP 6.0](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP) [3] dataset
- `all_seq.fasta`: Sequences for all data sets (without per-residue annotations)

The `cv` directory contains the individual cross-validation splits, once with annotations and once sequences only.

The `predictions` directory contains the predictions for the individual cross-validation test splits. For example, the file `cv_00.pred` contains the predictions generated by the model trained on splits 1-4 and evaluated on split 0. All predictions were generated using `--out-format=1`. The file `blacklist.txt` contains the 235 proteins excluded from the performance evaluations after the first revision of the manuscript.


## Annotations

Each residue is annotated with a single letter representing its class:
- `B`/`b`: Transmembrane beta strand
- `H`/`h`: Transmembrane alpha helix
- `S`: Signal peptide
- `1`: Non-Transmembrane, inside
- `2`: Non-Transmembrane, outside
- `U`: Unknown/Unresolved in PDB
